# The Bootstrap Practice!
 We learned Bootstrap - the <i>"the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites"</i>, and then we added Bootswatch to play around with themes.

 Learned how to:
 <br>
 <ul>
  <li>Add Header-Jumbotron</li>
  <li>Add Buttons, Pictures, Content</li>
  <li>Menu bar, Gallery, Footer</li>
 </ul>
